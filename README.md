## Preamble

This project provides a tool for helping people translating the custom language created for the game _Tunic_.

Warning: This tool contains **HEAVY** spoilers for the game. If you haven't played Tunic yet, I highly recommend doing so before using this tool. The game offers a beautiful experience, and the language is a significant part of its charm.

## Introduction

The Tunic Cipher is a tool designed to assist individuals in translating the custom language created for the game Tunic. It provides a user-friendly interface for selecting glyphs and instantly seeing their translations. Additionally, the tool allows users to save their queries, enabling them to easily resume their translation work between sessions.

By default, none of the glyphs are translated to encourage players to deduce the alphabet by themselves.

If you're not willing to go through the process of translating the glyphs, the tool provides a way to load the official translation.
